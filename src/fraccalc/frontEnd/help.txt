Welcome to Benjamin's Fraccalc!
This program is designed to satisfy all of your fractional calculational needs.
This program can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of fractions.
It will do this with order of operations, as well as process parentheses
Fractions can follow this format:
1_2/3
This represents the fraction one and two-thirds.
Fractions can also be represented as improper fractions, in this format:
2/3 
This represents two-thirds
Finally, fractions can simply be a whole number
1
This represents 1

Fractions should be seperated from operators by at least one space. Extra spaces are not nessecary, but valid.

1_2/3 + 1_2/3

This is valid

1_2/3         +     1_2/3

This is valid

1_2/3+ 1_2/3

This is not valid

Parentheses can be seperated by spaces from fractions, but do not have to be.
Fractions should not have spaces in them.

the letters ans will be replaced with the value of the last valid expression. (zero by default).
