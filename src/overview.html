This program takes a fractional expression and evaulates it.

Fractions should be of the form whole_numerator/denominator. They should be delimited from the operators by at least one space.
Parentheses do not need to be delimited from fractions.
when inputted, ans will be replaced by the answer of the previous entered valid expression. It defaults to zero.
If the input is quit or exit, the program will exit.
If the input is help, the program will print out help.txt

The program firstly checks to see if the input is help or quit. If it is, the input goes to one of those special cases.
Elsewise, the program will try to parse the expression given. The input is given to Parser.parse(). parse will first pass the expression to processParentheses.
If there are parentheses, processParentheses will pass the isolated expression back to parse, recursively getting rid of everything inside parentheses.
After that is done, the string without parentheses is passed to evaulate(), which the evaulates the expression.
